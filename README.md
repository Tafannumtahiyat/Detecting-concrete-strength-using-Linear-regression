# Detecting-concrete-strength-using-Linear-regression
Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable.
Here I detected concrete strength with tebular data using linear regression.
